<p align="justify">
I am pursuing a PhD degree in computer engineering from the Chosun university, Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Seokjoo Shin. I am a research assistant with the Dept. of Computer Engineering, Chosun univesirty, where I am a part of the Wireless Communication and Networking (WHYNET) group.

<br><br>
Currently, I am working on <i>Perceptual Encryption-based Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning applications</i>.

<br><br>
My research focuses on <b>Image Compression</b>, <b>Image Encryption</b>, <b>Image Communication</b>, and <b>Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning</b>.
