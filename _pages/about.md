<p align="justify">
I am pursuing a PhD degree in computer engineering from the Chosun university, Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Seokjoo Shin. I am a research assistant with the Dept. of Computer Engineering, Chosun univesirty, where I am a part of the Wireless Communication and Networking (WHYNET) group.

<br><br>
My research interests are in privacy preservation during data transmission – <i>in transit</i>, data storage – <i>at rest</i>, and computation – <i>in use</i>. The scope of my research spans across multiple fields, from image encryption to computer vision, including Machine Learning (ML) in the image analysis domain.

<br><br>
Currently, I am working on <i>Perceptual Encryption-based Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning applications</i>.

<br><br>
<b>Keywords:</b> <i>Image Compression, Image Encryption, Image Communication, and Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning</i>.
