<p align="justify">
I am a researcher with substantial experience in designing and implementing AI-based computer vision solutions for a wide range of applications. Throughout the years, I have developed capabilities to undertake research from conception to write-up and disseminate my findings in journals and conferences. My work has received recognition awards in national and international conferences.

<br><br>
I have recently completed a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Chosun university, where I am currently a part of the Wireless Communication and Networking (WHYNET) group and working as a researcher. The topic of my ongoing research is <i> Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning via Perceptual Encryption</i>.

<br><br>
My research interests are in privacy preservation during data transmission – <i>in transit</i>, data storage – <i>at rest</i>, and computation – <i>in use</i>. The scope of my research spans across multiple fields, from image encryption to computer vision, including Machine Learning (ML) in the image analysis domain.
