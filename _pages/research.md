My research interests are in privacy preservation during data transmission – in transit, data storage – at rest, and computation – in use. The scope of my research spans across multiple fields, from image encryption to computer vision, including Machine Learning (ML) in the image analysis domain. <br>

There are two main challenges in the development and implementation of Deep Learning (DL) solutions: First, DL algorithms are characterized as compute-intensive tasks, and their training requires innovative technology and high computational resources. Second, training DL models for a particular task needs a large volume of sample data, which in some domains such as in the field of medical image analysis, is expensive and difficult to acquire. These challenges can be efficiently addressed by taking advantage of powerful infrastructures such as cloud services. For example, in the first case, organizations can avail cloud-computing services to access the latest technology to speed-up the training process and allow DL models to scale efficiently with a lower capital cost. Similarly, to mitigate the data deficiency challenge, an organization can benefit from a community cloud, where services are shared by organizations with common interests to achieve their goals. In this case, cloud storage services can be utilized as a shared data repository for joint collaborative learning. <br>

This avail of third-party resources provides an efficient solution for a well-trained DL model; however, this can lead to privacy concerns as data outsourcing comes with a risk of information leakage. Though the traditional image encryption techniques guarantee data security in transit and at rest, data decryption is necessary prior to performing any computations on them, which makes them inadequate to cater to the requirements of data security in use. On the other hand, techniques specifically proposed to enable computation in the encryption domain have either their associated computational cost, communication overhead or specialized design requirement that may reduce data utility and degrade the DL model performance. In addition, when transmitting large volumes of data (especially images), compression is necessary to efficiently utilize the available bandwidth. Therefore, I argue for a holistic privacy-preserving solution that can satisfy the dual requirements of data transmission, data storage and computation in the encryption domain to fully reap the benefits of DL for data-driven applications.
