<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The performance of an edge detector can be
improved when assisted with an effective edge map quality
measure. Several evaluation methods have been proposed
resulting in different performance score for the same candidate
edge map. However, an effective measure is the one that can be
automated and which correlates with human judgement
perceived quality of the edge map. Distance-based edge map
measures are widely used for assessment of edge map quality.
These methods consider distance and statistical properties of
edge pixels to estimate a performance score. The existing
methods can be automated; however, they lack perceptual
features. This paper presents edge map quality measure based on
Just-Noticeable-Difference (JND) feature of human visual
system, to compensate the shortcomings of distance-based edge
measures. For this purpose, we have designed constant stimulus
experiment to measure the JND value for two spatial alternative.
Experimental results show that JND based distance calculation
outperforms existing distance-based measures according to
subjective evaluation.</p>
