<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Image compression and encryption1are two processes that enable
telemedicine application of eHealth services. However,
performing these operations on the whole content of an image is
computationally expensive. This work proposes a method for
selective compression and selective encryption of medical images.
It is based on lossless compression and encryption of the region of
interest (ROI) in medical images. The non-ROI part of the image
is compressed in lossy mode and is stored or transmitted as plain
data, in order to further reduce the image size and to avoid the
computational cost of encrypting huge volumes of medical
images. Our analysis shows that the proposed method provides the
necessary security and is secured against various attacks. In
addition, the compression savings achieved by the proposed
method is about 28% while preserving the crucial information in
the ROI for correct diagnosis. For a quality factor of 80%, the
reconstructed image has a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 42.5 dB.
The proposed method requires less computational resources and
enables processing of huge volume of image data in low power
network.</p>
