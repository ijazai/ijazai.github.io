<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Transfer learning significantly improves the
performance of a deep learning model on challenging datasets.
However, the pre-trained models have certain constraints in
terms of their architecture. For example, the state-of-the-art
pre-trained models expect an input image with three-color
channels because of the wide availability of color images.
However, there are certain domains, e.g., medical applications,
where grayscale images are produced and the models are
required to perform certain tasks on them. Therefore, in this
work we propose an approach to run pre-trained models on
grayscale images while benefiting from transfer learning for
multiclass classification task. We have used the MobileNetV2
pre-trained model to classify the CIFAR datasets. We have
compared our results with a conventional method where the
grayscale image is stacked up to form a pseudo-color image. Our
analysis have shown that the proposed method reduces the
computational time per epoch while improves the accuracy of
the model.</p>
