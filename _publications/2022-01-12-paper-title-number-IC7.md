<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In the recent years, encryption-then-compression
(EtC) algorithms are becoming popular for multimedia
applications due to their low computational requirements and
format compliancy with the JPEG image standard. In this study,
we first extend the applications of EtC algorithms to medical
image processing domain. Then, given importance of medical
data, we propose a method to improve the security performance
of the conventional EtC schemes with acceptable degradation in
the compression savings but without compromising quality of
the recovered images. We have implemented a deep learning
(DL) model for tuberculosis (TB) screening in Montgomery
datasets. Our analysis shows that the recovered images are of
high quality and has no adverse effect on the accuracy of the DL
model for TB detection. The proposed method preserves the
crucial information in the image necessary for correct diagnosis
while significantly reducing the image size and providing
security to enable telemedicine application of eHealth services.</p>
