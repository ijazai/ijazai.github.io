<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The intriguing nature of jigsaw puzzle has
captured the attention of researchers for many years. In this
paper, we propose a deep learning model to determine different
states of jigsaw puzzle from an image. We represent the task as
a classification problem where each state of the puzzle is
considered as a class. For this purpose, we have proposed a
method to generate a dataset that can efficiently represent the
jigsaw puzzle states space. The proposed model has 93%
accuracy on the test dataset. In addition, we have shown that
when the tiles size changes the model is still able to recognize
83% of the states. Though, genetic algorithms (GA) have been
successful in solving larger puzzles, they require hand-crafted
sophisticated compatibility scores. The computation and
memory requirement to store the piecewise compatibility
measure increases with the size of the puzzle. As an application,
we have shown that the proposed method can be used as a fitness
function of GA based jigsaw puzzle solver without using any
compatibility measure.</p>
