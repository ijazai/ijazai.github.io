<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This work presents privacy-preserving surveillance
system for smart cities based on perceptual encryption algorithm (PE).
The encryption is block-based and provides necessary level of security
while preserving intrinsic properties of an image necessary for
compression. Unlike existing PE methods, the proposed method
retains color information, thus can enable processing in encryption
domain. The analysis shows that our method achieves same
compression performance as existing methods while providing better
security. In addition, we have performed face recognition on the
encrypted images and demonstrated that the proposed method delivers
the same recognition accuracy as that of the plain images.</p>
