<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Lossy image compression provides an efficient
solution to the exchange and storage of image data for consumer
applications. The design of lossy algorithms is based on a
principle to discard information that are not perceivable by
human visual system (HVS). With the popularity of deep
learning models (DL) in computer vision (CV), it is necessary to
characterize the loss in image quality with respect to computer
vision systems as well. Recent studies have analyzed the image
distortions resulted from blur and noise, mainly from an
adversarial attack perspective. However, fewer studies have
dealt with the lossy nature of the JPEG algorithm. Therefore,
the current study presents a quantitative assessment of different
types of data loss that occurs due to chroma subsampling,
quantization, and rounding functions of the JPEG algorithm. In
addition, we have analyzed impact of different interpolation
methods that are used for chroma upsampling. The analysis
have shown that for compression savings, performing either
subsampling or quantization preserved the model accuracy
while their combination degraded the accuracy by 6%.</p>
