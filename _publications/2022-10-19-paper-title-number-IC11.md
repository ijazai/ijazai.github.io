<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, cloud
computations are widely utilized to train a deep learning model
on public datasets. The trained model can then be deployed on
edge devices as an inference engine to facilitate various IoT
applications in real-time. For consistent accurate predictions,
the model needs to be retrained on the most recent data. This
necessitates the data share between cloud servers and edge
devices. However, the data acquired by IoT end devices usually
consists of sensitive information and sharing them with cloud
services provider results in users' privacy issues. In addition, the
exchange of large volume of data requires high bandwidth. This
study proposes an extension of block-based perceptual
encryption (PE) algorithm to enable DL computations in
encryption domain in order to protect usersâ€™ privacy. For this
purpose, four different extensions of baseline PE methods were
analyzed in terms of compression savings, encryption efficiency
and privacy-preserving DL performance. The analyses have
shown that when global contents are preserved in each color
channel, the extended PE method offers better security and
preserves compression savings with only 3% drop in accuracy
as compared to baseline method.</p>
