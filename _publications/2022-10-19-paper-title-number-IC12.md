<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Channel correction plays an important role in
performance of wireless communication systems. In
conventional systems, channel estimation is one of the blocks at
receiver side to compute channel impulse response. Various
algorithms have been proposed to make them efficient and
improve their performance. However, precise channel
estimation incurs additional computational cost and increases
complexity of the overall system. In this study, we have
considered the otherwise to bypass channel estimation of an
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based
image communication system designed to enable cloud-based
deep learning (DL) computation. The simulations present
performance analysis of OFDM system with and without
channel correction in-terms of bit error rate (BER), and two
image quality measures. Recovered image quality difference
between the two systems significantly increases with higher
Eb/N0. For inferencing analysis, in higher Eb/N0 regions, model
performance on images recovered with correction is same as on
the original images while lags behind by 6% on images without
correction. In lower Eb/N0 regions, the model accuracy reduces
by 10% on average for both systems. In addition, the model
accuracy shows overlapping pattern in that region and for 3 dB,
it has performed better on images recovered without correction.</p>
