<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Perceptual encryption (PE) of images protects visual information while retaining the intrinsic properties necessary to enable computation in the encryption domain. Block–based PE produces JPEG-compliant images with almost the same compression savings as that of the plain images. The methods represent an input color image as a pseudo grayscale image to benefit from a smaller block size. However, such representation degrades image quality and compression savings, and removes color information, which limits their applications. To solve these limitations, we proposed inter and intra block processing for compressible PE methods (IIB–CPE). The method represents an input as a color image and performs block-level inter processing and sub-block-level intra processing on it. The intra block processing results in an inside–out geometric transformation that disrupts the symmetry of an entire block thus achieves visual encryption of local details while preserving the global contents of an image. The intra block-level processing allows the use of a smaller block size, which improves encryption efficiency without compromising compression performance. Our analyses showed that IIB–CPE offers 15% bitrate savings with better image quality than the existing PE methods. In addition, we extended the scope of applications of the proposed IIB–CPE to the privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) domain.</p>
