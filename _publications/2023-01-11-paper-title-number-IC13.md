<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The widespread adoption of deep learning (DL)
solutions in the healthcare organizations is obstructed by their
compute intensive nature and dependability on massive
datasets. In this regard, cloud–services such as cloud storage
and computational resources are emerging as an effective
solution. However, when the image data are outsourced to avail
such services, there is a privacy concern that the data should be
kept protected not only during transmission but during
computations as well. To meet these requirements, this study
proposed a privacy-preserving DL (PPDL) scheme that enable
computations without the need of decryption. The encryption is
based on perceptual encryption (PE) that only hides the
perceivable information in an image while preserves other
characteristics that are necessary for DL computations.
Precisely, we have implemented a binary classifier based on
EfficientNetV2 for the COVID-19 screening in the chest X-ray
(CXR) images. For the PE algorithm, the suitability of two pixelbased
and two block-based PE methods was analyzed. The
analysis have shown that when global contents are left
unmodified (pixel-based PE), then the DL-based model achieved
the classification accuracy same as that of the plain images. On
the other hand, for block-based PE algorithms, there is up to 3%
drop in the model’s accuracy and sensitivity scores.</p>
