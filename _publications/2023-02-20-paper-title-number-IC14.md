<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In a standard Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplex (OFDM)-based communication system, higher order
M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) increases
throughput and link capacity significantly due to the larger
number of bits per symbol. Such a system is suitable to transmit
large volumes of image data for real-time Internet of Things
(IoT) applications. However, higher order M-QAM increases
the noise margin and Bit Error Rate (BER) in the received
signal. Although the error bits corrupt the individual pixels
values, the global contents of the image may remain intact and
can be interpreted by Deep Learning (DL) models. Therefore,
the current study analyzes the robustness of DL models for
image communication systems utilizing higher order M-QAM.
The performance analysis of the system is presented in terms of
the BER and image quality measures. In the analysis, distortions
in the reconstructed images decrease significantly when using
higher Eb/N0 across all M-QAM. For higher Eb/N0 in the 1024-
QAM system, the performance of the model improved by 11%
and obtained an accuracy of 86%, lagging by 6% compared to
the accuracy obtained on the original images. Overall, the model
maintained a high accuracy range between 83% and 90% at
Eb/N0 10 dB across all M-QAM.
