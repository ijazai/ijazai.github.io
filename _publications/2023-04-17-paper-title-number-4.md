<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Perceptual encryption (PE) hides the identifiable information of an image in such a way that its intrinsic characteristics remain intact.
This recognizable perceptual quality can be used to enable computation in the encryption domain. A class of PE algorithms based 
on block-level processing has recently gained popularity for their ability to generate JPEG-compressible cipher images. 
A tradeoff in these methods, however, is between the security efficiency and compression savings due to the chosen block size. 
Several methods (such as the processing of each color component independently, image representation, and sub-block-level processing) 
have been proposed to effectively manage this tradeoff. The current study adapts these assorted practices into a uniform framework to 
provide a fair comparison of their results. Specifically, their compression quality is investigated under various design parameters, 
such as the choice of colorspace, image representation, chroma subsampling, quantization tables, and block size. Our analyses have 
shown that at best the PE methods introduce a decrease of 6% and 3% in the JPEG compression performance with and without chroma 
subsampling, respectively. Additionally, their encryption quality is quantified in terms of several statistical analyses. 
The simulation results show that block-based PE methods exhibit several favorable properties for the encryption-then-compression schemes. 
Nonetheless, to avoid any pitfalls, their principal design should be carefully considered in the context of the applications for 
which we outlined possible future research directions.</p>
